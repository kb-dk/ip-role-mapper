Thank you for the interest in the DOMS project.

-- Overview of the DOMS Surveyor --

This is the Surveyor for the DOMS project. It's purpose is to get a single
point of access for monitoring the state of the DOMS system. The state is
based on a realtime status monitoring of the current state of the system,
and information extracted from warnings and errors in the system logs. This
information is exposed in a REST webservice, and a web application gathers
the information and presents it on a web page.

The Surveyor contains the following modules:
 * status: This module contains the interface used by the rest web services.
 * rest: This module contains a logging appender, that exposes the logs with
         a rest web service.
 * surveyor: This module contains the web application that presents the
             information on a web page.

More information is avialable in the README files of each module.

Systems that should be monitored by the Surveyor should each be set up to
use the logging appender from the rest module, and implement the interface
from status to present real time information.
